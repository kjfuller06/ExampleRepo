# hexSticker_augmented
## This repository is for generating hexagon stickers. It applies ggplot2 to create a hexagon-shaped background image in the form of a PNG with transparent background. Includes code to overlay with another PNG. The result can be used in the hexSticker package to create a custom hexagon sticker for the hexbin repo.
